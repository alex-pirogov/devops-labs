# Understanding Version Control Systems

## Definition of VCS and their purpose
VCS is a software tool that helps track changes to files over time. Its purpose is to enable collaboration, maintain a history of different versions, facilitate merging of changes, and provide backup and recovery capabilities. 

## Benefits and advantages of using VCS
VCS ensures efficient software development, version tracking, and team coordination.

## Centralized VS distributed VCS
In **centralized** VCS the central server that stores the repository, and multiple users interact with the repository on the server.
In **distributed** VCS each user has a complete copy of the repository, including its full history, on their local machine. Users can commit changes to their local repository, create branches, and merge changes independently.

## Comparison of popular VCS
### Git
- Distributed version control system (DVCS).
- Powerful branching and merging.
- Fast and efficient.
- Strong community support and extensive tooling.
- Steep learning curve.
### Subversion (SVN):
- Centralized version control system (CVCS).
- Established and widely used.
- Robust versioning and access control.
- Suitable for simpler workflows and smaller teams.
- Slower on large repositories.
### Mercurial (Hg):
- Distributed version control system (DVCS).
- Focuses on ease of use.
- Similar to Git but with a more intuitive interface.
- Suitable for small to medium-sized projects.
- Smaller user base and tooling compared to Git.
